## Goal

To create a website for NSVC that will take over the current one. The new one will be more improved with a registration and login for ahtletes. When an athlete creates and account and pays for a membership they will be able to join practice times. They will be able to see how long until membership will end. The website will also include the pole inventory of the club. This will show who is renting poles and which poles are curretly rented out.
